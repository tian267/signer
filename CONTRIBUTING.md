## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher
- npm or yarn
- OpenSSL (for certificate operations)
- Git

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/laniot/signer.git
   cd signer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create your environment configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your settings
   ```

4. Run the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Code Style

### JavaScript/Node.js
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use ES6+ modern JavaScript features
- Use `async/await` for asynchronous operations
- Follow existing code patterns
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Naming Conventions
- `camelCase` for functions and variables
- `PascalCase` for classes
- `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- Use descriptive names that convey intent

### Comments
- Use `//` for single-line comments
- Use `/** */` for JSDoc documentation
- Document public APIs and complex logic

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. Run the linter (if configured):
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

2. Test the server locally:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Test the `/v1/sign` endpoint with valid credentials
4. Verify certificate generation works correctly
5. Test rate limiting functionality
6. Test with different certificate formats (PEM, base64, DER)

## Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Update DEPLOYMENT.md for deployment-related changes
- Add inline code documentation
- Update configuration examples if needed
