NOTICE:
This software is designed to work with IoT devices and provides certificate
signing services. Users must provide their own:
- Intermediate CA certificate and private key
- Authentication tokens for API access
- Secure infrastructure for deployment

The software does not include or provide access to certificate authorities,
intermediate certificates, or authentication credentials.

The example configurations and documentation references are for illustrative
purposes only. Users are responsible for:
- Securing their own credentials and certificates
- Implementing proper security measures in production
- Protecting their intermediate CA private keys
- Managing certificate lifecycles appropriately
- Complying with PKI best practices and regulations

For production deployments, it is strongly recommended to:
- Use Hardware Security Modules (HSM) or Key Management Systems (KMS)
- Implement device-specific authentication and allowlists
- Keep certificate lifetimes short (1-7 days)
- Monitor and audit all certificate signing requests
- Follow industry security standards and best practices
